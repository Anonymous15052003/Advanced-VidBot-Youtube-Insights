Project Outline: Video Summarization with OpenCV and YOLO


Objective: Summarize a video by detecting and extracting key scenes, objects, and events using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OpenCV for video processing.


Steps:

Set up the environment: Install necessary libraries like OpenCV, YOLO, etc.
Process video using OpenCV: Read the video and break it down into frames.
Object detection using YOLO: Use pre-trained YOLO models to detect objects in each frame.
Key frame extraction: Identify key frames based on object presence and scene changes.
Generate summary: Extract key frames or scenes and provide a summary of the detected objects and actions.
