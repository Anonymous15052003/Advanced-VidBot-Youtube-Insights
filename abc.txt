November 26, 2008, which is known as 26/11, a date written in the pages of history by dark officers, and the people of India can never forget this day because on that day, 10 terrorists from the Lashkar-e-Taiba group entered Mumbai via sea route from Karachi, Pakistan, and carried out attacks at five different locations. One of the places targeted was the iconic Taj Mahal Palace, a five-star hotel that had been a symbol of Mumbai's pride for 118 years. On the night of November 26 at 9:40 pm, a group of four terrorists entered the Taj Mahal and indiscriminately fired, killing people in the hotel's other rooms. While Mumbai's pride, the Taj Hotel, was burning and people were being killed, amidst the horrifying scene, there were also tales of bravery written with our brave soldiers' blood. One such story is about Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, a brave officer of the Indian Army and a commando of the National Security Guard (NSG), who was martyred while facing the terrorists during the 26/11 attacks. For his courage and valor, he was posthumously honored with India's highest peacetime gallantry award, the Ashoka Chakra. A movie is being made on Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan's life, named "Major", where actor Adivi Sesh plays the role of Sandeep Unnikrishnan. Letâ€™s take a look at his inspiring life story.

Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was born on March 15, 1977, in Kerala. His father's name is Unnikrishnan, who was a former officer of ISRO, and his mother's name is Dhanalakshmi Unnikrishnan. Sandeep was their only child. He studied at Frank Anthony Public School in Bangalore, and from his school days, he aspired to join the army. Due to his dedication and athletic abilities, he actively participated in school activities and sports. Even after leaving school, no one could break his records. After completing his 12th grade in Science in 1995, he appeared for the NDA (National Defence Academy) entrance exam and was selected for the 94th course of the NDA. After three years at NDA and one year at IMA (Indian Military Academy), he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Bihar Regiment Infantry on June 12, 1999.

Soon after, he got the opportunity to participate in Operation Vijay during the Kargil War. Following the Kargil War, he was promoted to the rank of Captain and later to Major on June 12, 2002. He excelled during his commando training and was sent for the high-altitude warfare course at the High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg. Subsequently, he served in locations like Siachen Glacier, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. Afterward, he decided to join the NSG in January 2007. After completing NSG training, he was appointed as a training officer in the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG.

On November 26, when terrorists attacked Mumbai, it initially seemed like a routine gang incident, but as the bodies started piling up in hospitals, it became evident that it was a pre-planned terrorist attack. Local police and ATS attempted to confront the terrorists initially, but tackling these terrorists was beyond the capability of the police alone. Many police and ATS personnel died bravely confronting the terrorists, indicating the complexity of the situation. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the NSG was called in. By then, crucial 10 hours had already passed since the start of the crisis. The number of terrorists and their weaponry was unknown to anyone. NSG planned an operation named 'Operation Black Tornado' to neutralize the terrorists and evacuate hostages. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was the team commander of this operation. On November 27, leading a team of 10 commandos, Sandeep and his team entered the hotel. They systematically rescued a total of 14 hostages from all the rooms on the first floor. During the operation, Sandeep's companion commando Sunil Yadav was shot. Without a second thought for his life, Sandeep jumped to save him and safely evacuated him, but during this act of bravery, Sandeep was also shot by the terrorists. Despite being wounded, he continued to fight the terrorists and instructed his commandos not to enter the area he was handling as he would manage. Alone and battling the terrorists courageously, he achieved martyrdom. His last words, "Do not come up, I will handle them," epitomize his courage and valor, and these words became famous later on. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was honored with the Ashoka Chakra for his bravery in the face of fear and valor. His sacrifice, along with that of other brave soldiers, will never be forgotten by the people of India. If you liked this video, please like and write "Jai Hind" in the comment box. Jai Hind.
