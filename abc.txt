[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Music] Jay Hind viewers, how are you all? Response to the channel is awesome. Thanks a lot for this blog. I am creating this because numerous people on my social media handles, young motivated individuals, ask how to join Special Forces. If you see the history of this channel, which I started in July last year, initially in my first two or three episodes, I created a blog on how to join Special Forces. Now, I will tell you again how you can join Special Forces. The ones I am talking about are the Indian Army's Special Forces, namely the Para Special Forces. I am not talking about Marcos or Garud here. I have not served in those units, but I have operated with them in many places. How their selection process works, in terms of the rigor of training, and how the Navy and Air Force select them is not within my knowledge. To be frank, I am telling you about how to join the Para Special Forces in the Indian Army. For that, there are two ways: basically, after completing your pre-commissioning training, i.e., OTA or IMA, you can either voluntarily join the volunteers SF units and Parachute Regiment, or you can join them post serving in the regular army. You can select the Para SF only after serving for three months of probation, which involves physical and mental tests similar to the regular Indian Army standards. The SF tasks are most operationally challenging, emphasizing silent, swift operations in the most demanding scenarios. Therefore, the Para SF selection process is designed accordingly. As I mentioned, you can volunteer to join the Para SF units after your academy training, or as a second way, you can join them when you are already in service with any army or service - Infantry, Artillery, Signals, Ordnance, ASC, Engineers, Army Air Defence, etc.; you can transfer to the volunteer forces as per vacancies and availability. Many people ask me how to join the volunteer forces; be part of an elite regiment, and there are many things. In the Special Forces, you will have exposure to operational combat like no other, full of adventure such as parachute jumping, underwater diving, and other adventures not found anywhere else. You will receive the best equipment - weapons, communication equipment, or war-like stores, depending on your requirements for the highly specialized tasks, which normal army personnel do not get. It is a matter of great honor and pride that, as a Para SF soldier, you are not just seen as a soldier for the Army, but as a true blue warrior. In the last five and a half years, I've been through the Parachute Regiment and Special Forces. I can tell you one thing - there hasn't been a single day when I regretted my decision because the Combat Exposure Adventure, which was my dream, was fulfilled by all the Para SF troopers. I hope this blog helps empower you to take that leap of faith and join the Para Special Forces, as some youngsters think they can join from anywhere. Remember, to join the voluntary forces for Para Special Forces, the first step is to join the Indian Army, whether you are a civilian or an officer in other services. From the sister services, I would say, CRPF and paramilitary forces are different from us in Para SF. So, I would say to achieve your dream, the first aim is to join the Indian Army. There is no system in place where you can directly join the Para SF after college; there is no provision for that. Keep in mind that when you volunteer for Para Special Forces, it means you are opting for a way of life, a way of adventure, voluntary service that maximizes patriotism beyond anything you will experience elsewhere. Thank you kindly for supporting the channel. If you have any content queries, which are within my capacity, I will definitely address them. Have a nice day. Stay tuned for more videos like this.
