In India, every minute, people experience heart attacks, and it's life-threatening. People have never really thought about the health of this heart. These people in the age group of 30 to 50 faced a heart attack after about 8-10 hours. After seeing these poor people suffer a heart attack, people realized the importance of heart health. Even fit people are also experiencing heart attacks. The story continues in the next number [music]. Don't fear, this is a scientific and awareness video. But the question is whether the young Indians who are losing their lives to heart attacks continuously are due to the corona vaccine, due to going to the gym, or is it something else entirely. Finally, we will talk about this in the bigger picture as well - what's happening in which jazz, what's going on with your heart, i.e., the pumping of nutrients and oxygen-rich blood throughout your body. And how this supply happens - blue is pumped through the arteries in your body just like your home water motor pumps water into the tanks. Well, the pumping chamber in your heart, the left ventricle, contracts to 75 and the blue blood flows through your arteries to your entire body. It's not just an artery; arteries are just bigger tubes. In simple terms, your heart is a pipe connected to your circulatory system that sends blood throughout your body. The issue here is that when substances and cholesterol build up inside these arteries, known as plaques, the arteries lining can get damaged and these plaques can block the arteries. If the coronary arteries narrow down, the muscles in your heart won't receive enough oxygen, which can lead to a heart attack. To better understand the mechanism of a heart attack, let me share some real-life examples with you. On August 10, 2022, comedian Raju Srivastava had a heart attack in the gym. The news spread slowly, and people said, "Don't go to the gym," but is there any truth in that? So why did Raju Srivastava have a heart attack in the gym? Well, it's because when a person works out, their heart pumps blood faster, and if they overdo intense workouts, it can cause unexpected stress on the heart muscles and increase the chances of the arteries getting damaged, leading to heart-related issues. So when you go to the gym, right after entering, you see a friend doing intense workouts on the right, someone else doing pushups on the left, and somebody lifting heavy weights. Avoid doing foolish heavy workouts that can put unexpected load on your heart muscles and walls of arteries. It's important not to neglect stretching before exercising and ensuring your body is prepared for it. A heart attack occurs when arteries get blocked due to certain unhealthy lifestyle habits. Essentially, people should be cautious of consuming too much salt, refined sugar, and particularly wheat flour. Studies suggest that a person should not consume more than 5 grams of salt in a day due to any condition. However, a report states that Indians, on average, consume 11 grams of salt per day, double the recommended limit. Professionals recommend not consuming more than 30 grams of sugar in a day, regardless of your condition. Maida, for example, is harmful as it sticks to your digestive system and is considered junk in Ayurveda. The rapid consumption of sugar and refined carbohydrates causes a sudden increase in sugar levels in your body, leading to various health issues. Therefore, it is crucial to balance your diet and lifestyle to prevent heart attacks. Heart experts warn against smoking or consuming unhealthy substances, as smoking can cause serious damage to your heart before a heart attack strikes. About 30% of people's lives are at risk within the first hour of a heart attack, and within 8 to 10 minutes, it becomes critical. Understanding CPR is crucial during heart attacks, and despite the risk of breaking ribs during CPR, it should be performed continuously as a life-saving measure. These are some important things to keep in mind to prevent a heart attack which are really crucial. Also, listening to heart experts is essential - "I would never smoke, never smoke anything, I never smoke, it's so beautiful." etc. Smoking slowly damages the lungs and heart.
