This is quite a lengthy text. Here is the translation into English:

Once upon a time, in the Rajgarh tehsil of Alwar district in Rajasthan, there was a small village. In that village, there lived a boy named Sonu with his small family. When Sonu passed his 12th grade, his parents decided to send him to the city for further studies. Upon arriving in the city and joining his friends, Sonu quickly fell prey to the fast-food culture. Within a few days of consuming fast food, he started experiencing issues with his digestive health. Upset by his deteriorating digestive health, Sonu went straight to the doctor and asked, "Doctor Sahab, when I was in the village, I never had any gut issues. I never experienced constipation or burning sensations. However, I don't know what's happening to me since coming to the city." The doctor explained to Sonu, "Whatever you eat ends up going through your mouth, down your food pipe, into your stomach, then into your small intestine, and from there into your large intestine before finally exiting your body. However, this process is not as straightforward as you might have read in childhood. An average person consumes approximately 675 kg of food in a year. This simple means that about 2 kg of food is processed per day. Now, what fuel will your body derive from this food to provide energy, and what will be the waste excreted from your body? Understand how the digestive system impacts our body. In addition, an almond digests differently from a momo, and we will also delve into how both are processed. Instead of delving into typical bio-chemical terms right away, we will discuss how real-life food science impacts our digestive system. But before we dive into that, let's first understand that digestion begins the moment you put food in your mouth. There are three major salivary glands present in your mouth - the parotid glands under your jawbone, the submandibular glands under your tongue, and the sublingual glands under your tongue. When you think about food, smell food, or look at food, saliva starts to be released. Now, you might know that saliva helps with chewing and swallowing food, but there are two aspects related to saliva that you might not know. Firstly, saliva contains antibodies that kill germs in your mouth, helping to keep your mouth clean. Secondly, saliva contains an enzyme called amylase, which breaks down the carbohydrates present in your food for digestion. Then, as you swallow the food, an amazing process begins through the esophagus that prevents food from entering the windpipe and guides it into the food pipe. Pay attention to the fact that the windpipe leads to your lungs. if any food enters there, it can cause issues. Therefore, the epiglottis, located at the top of the windpipe, blocks the opening when you swallow food, preventing it from entering the windpipe, and directs it into the food pipe. Before the rest of the video, you will encounter a piece of food called a bolus after chewing and swallowing the food. This process is known as 'bolusing'. There are several English words used in this video that we don't typically use in real life. Remembering these difficult words and understanding the concepts in specialized English can be challenging for many people. For this, the best solution is the Duolingo app, which is the most popular free language learning app in the world. This app offers more than 40 languages like English, French, German, Spanish, and others.

Now, to explain the process in food digestion, the food you eat passes through the mouth, then down the esophagus, and finally enters the stomach. Let's delve into the intricacies of digestion and how it impacts the human body.
